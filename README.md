## Description

Often in our boot-camp class we would chat, and discuss various movies. This gave us the idea for our project to make a database of reviews using everything we have learned. We wanted the ability to write a review on any movie, and have posters, and data implemented with each review. We set about to create this community project that can be used to share our thoughts and opinions on various movies we have seen.

## Installation
These steps are for if a user wishes to download the repo and run the application on their own local server.

*Note 'postgres' and 'password' are the default PostgresSQL username and password, if the user has a different username or password, then the 'postgres' and 'password' in step 3 must be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the user must set the values in their ``.env`` file, in step 2..

1. Download, copy, or clone the code to your local machine through GitHub and open in VSCode, or another appropriate IDE. 

2. The user must setup a .env file with the following:

    ```DB_NAME='moviereview_db'```

    ```DB_USER="postgres"```

    ```DB_PASSWORD="password"```

   ``` API_KEY = ""```

   ```API_SEARCH_DOMAIN = ""```

   ```API_RELEASE_DOMAIN = ""```

   *A TMBD API key can be obtained from: https://developer.themoviedb.org/.
   Additionally both domain keys can be found here: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started under "Now Playing", and "SEARCH: Movie", respectively.

3. Right click on 'server.js' and select 'Open In Integrated Terminal', then run the command ```npm install``` to install all required node files. 

4. The user must then launch Postgres by running the command: ```psql -U postgres```, in the terminal then running the command: ```password```. 

5. Continue in the terminal by running the command: ```\i db/schema.sql```, to initialize their database, then run the command: ```\q```, to exit PostresSQL.

6. Once out of Postgres the user can run the command: ```npm start```, to launch the application.
